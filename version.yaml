helmReplace:
# The helm chart started as a community effort and started off using v1.x.y
# while the main project remained conservatively at v0.x.y.
# Perhaps we'll converge in the future, but for now let's just deal with it with a version mapping.
- replace: "v0"
  with: "1"

# The new helm chart has been manually version bumped beyond the app version before we established
# the "-rN" suffix convention. This rule ensures that the linter doesn't choke on that version.
- replace: "1.13.1-r2"
  with: "1.13.2-r2"
