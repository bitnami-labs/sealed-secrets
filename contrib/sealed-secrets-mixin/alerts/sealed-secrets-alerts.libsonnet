        // Method: Alert on occurence of errors by looking for a non-zero rate of errors over past 5 minutes
        // Pros:
        // - An app deploy is likely broken if a secret can't be updated by Controller.
        // Caveats:
        // - Probably better to leave app deploy breakages to the app or CD systems monitoring.
        // - Potentially noisy. Controller attempts to unseal 5 times, so if it exceeds on the 4th attempt then all is fine but this alert will trigger.
        // - Usage of an invalid cert.pem with kubeseal will trigger this alert, it would be better to distinguish alerts due to controller or user
        // - 'for' clause not used because we are unlikely to have a sustained rate of errors unless there is a LOT of secret churn in cluster.
